Description:
This project is simplely designed for a elementary student to use. It includes for basic mathematical operations:
1: Addition 
2: Subtraction
3: Multiplication
4: Division 
The user will face 5 options when use the calculator, if the user provides a unappropriate input, the calculator will let him input one more time and show the information to the user.

add(): Function add() will add the users' input numbers. The returned value is the sum of this 2 numbers, and it will be return as float format.
       such as: 4 + 3.5 = 7.5 where 4 is the first input number, 3.5 is the second input number.

subtract(): Function subtract() will find the difference of  the users' input numbers. The returned value is the difference of this 2 numbers, and it will be return as float format.
       such as: 4 - 3.5 = 0.5 where 4 is the first input number, 3.5 is the second input number.

multiply(): Function multiply() will multiply the users' input numbers. The returned value is the product of this 2 numbers, and it will be return as float format.
       such as: 4 * 3.5 = 14.0 where 4 is the first input number, 3.5 is the second input number.

divide(): Function divide() will divide the users' input numbers. The returned value is the division of this 2 numbers, and it will be return as float format.
       such as: 8 / 2 = 4 where 8 is the first input number, 2 is the second input number.

If the user input 0 as a divisor, the program will return an error message "Wrong Divisor" and print the menu.
If the user input some word string, the program will return a message "Invalid Input".
